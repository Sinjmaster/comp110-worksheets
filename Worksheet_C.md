A) The program is doing a linear search where "i" and "j" duplicate each other.

B)Because the values of "i" and "j" are being checked every pair of values have to be check, due to this the values are duplicates and this is why the running time for the algorithm is quadratic in it's worst case.

C) The algarithum is still correct because "i" has already checked it's values while "j" continues to check it's own values and because "i" is before "j" in the algorithm this will not cause the algorithm to be incorrect.

D) Becuase "j" is now simply running behind "i" istead of in tangent with it neither "i" nor "j" will have to constanly compare each value they come across in the algorithm.

E)
